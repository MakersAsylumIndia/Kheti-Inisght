We are Team Kheti Insight!, 
Welcome to our Innovation School Project repository! We are a team of four students working on building a Smart Soil Monitoring Robot that helps measure and track key environmental factors for agriculture and research.

🔍 Problem Statement: 
Farmers and agricultural researchers often face challenges in manually monitoring soil conditions across large plots of land. Traditional methods are labor-intensive, inconsistent, and time-consuming, leading to inefficiencies in irrigation and crop management.

💡 Proposed Solution
Our robot automates the process of measuring soil temperature, moisture, and humidity using onboard sensors and actuators. By integrating a DHT22 sensor, a capacitive soil moisture sensor, an ESP32 microcontroller, and a robotic chassis, we provide a mobile and scalable solution for real-time soil health analysis. This enhances decision-making for sustainable farming.

🔩 Bill of Materials (BOM)
Component	Quantity	Description
ESP32 Development Board	1	Microcontroller with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
DHT22 Sensor	1	For measuring air temperature and humidity
Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor	1	For detecting moisture levels in soil
DC Motors + Wheels	2	For robot mobility

Breadboard	1	For prototyping

🌍 SDG Goals Associated
Goal 2: Zero Hunger – Supports sustainable agriculture through precision farming.

Goal 9: Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure – Promotes innovation in agri-tech.

Goal 13: Climate Action – Enables data-driven environmental monitoring and response.

🛠 Solution Overview
The robot is built on a modular chassis and controlled via an ESP32 board. The sensors collect real-time data:

The DHT22 captures ambient temperature and humidity.

The capacitive soil moisture sensor reads soil moisture levels.

This data is then processed by the ESP32 and can be transmitted or stored for later analysis. The actuators allow the robot to move to different soil patches, enabling wide-area environmental data collection.
